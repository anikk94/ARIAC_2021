Instructions to run GROUP 6 code:
----------------------------------
1. clone the ariac 2021/2022 packages into a new ros workspace in your home folder -> https://github.com/usnistgov/ARIAC.git
2. extract the group6 package into the workspace
3. replace the files that define competition conditions in ARIAC > nist_gear > config
4. run the following commands in a single terminal
5. run $ catkin build
6. run $ source <workspace>/devel/setup.bash (for bash users)
7. run $ roslaunch group6_rwa3 ariac.launch.

Alternatively:
---------------

Notes:
------
1. We are currently getting an error after the competition ends and the final agility score is displayed. The error is "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<boost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::lock_error> >". Due to our code running multiple threads ROS is not cleaning up these threads thus resulting in the error. We will be handling this issue in RWA_4.
2. Another error which is persistent is associated with tf2_ros. A service exception occurs "ServiceException: service [/main_node/tf2_frames] already registered". This error is associated with the get_target_world_pose() in moveit_runner.py from the RWA3_ENPM809E package uploaded by Dr. Kootbally. The same error is generated when we use the function in our RWA3 package.
